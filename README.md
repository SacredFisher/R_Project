<p> This repository contains an R project meant to invesigate based on the song analytics provided by the <a href=https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-playlist> Spotify Developer Web API </a>. From this we can get a variety of song statistics, like those provided by various song ranking websites like <a href=https://tunebat.com/> Tunebat</a>, and others. This way, by pulling the playlists of the <a href = https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/>Billboard Hot 100</a> songs, we can investigate the charachteristics of their performance on the chart vs the song charachteristics, by comparing those songs with a maximum rank in the Billboard top 5 and those songs that did not crack the top 75 of the Top 100 by their musical features, we can see what it takes to make a Billboard Top 5 Song. We can get the Billboard Hot 100 Historical Data from a <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs> Kaggle Dataset </a></p>
