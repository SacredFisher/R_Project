# What makes a Billboard Top 3 Song?
 The project.R file contains the code wherein the analysis of the <a href = https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/>Billboard Hot 100</a> Songs is done. To answer what makes a Billboard song popular, we must investigate the properties of each of the songs, and compare them to the properties of songs that did not perform as well as others on the Billboard Charts. We accomplish this by comparing those whose maximum rank on the Hot 100 chart was at least 3, and songs that stayed on the charts the longest, with songs that stayed on the charts for less than a week, and songs that whose maximum rank did not surpass 75.

 Finding these songs within particular ranges of years is not very complicated. However, analyzing songs and figuring out their properties is. Luckily, we are able to 
invesigate based on the song analytics provided by the <a href=https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-playlist> Spotify Developer Web API </a>. From this we can get a variety of song statistics, like those provided by various song ranking websites like <a href=https://tunebat.com/> Tunebat</a>. These include: Tempo, Energy, Dancibility, Happiness, and many more subjective properties of songs that have been quantified on a 0 to 1 scale by Spotify. Combining this data with the Billboard Hot 100 Data from this <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs> Kaggle Dataset </a>, we can find the correlation between different properties and compare them between songs that have found great success on the Billboard and songs that have not.
